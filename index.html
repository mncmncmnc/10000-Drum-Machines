                <h2>
                    <p>Back in 2019, I sketched out a couple of designs for web-based drum machines.
                    I didn't actually code them until 2025 and then thought, ok, that was fun, I should make more.</p> 
                    <p>Why 10,000? I don't know.</p> 
                    <p>I was trying to come up with a name for a collection of drum machines and "10,000 DRUM MACHINES" was the 
                        only thing that came to mind. </p>
                    <p>I probably won't ever reach that lofty number (a life 
                    expectancy assumption of 75 years only gives me <span id="days-left">13,182</span> days left), but maybe we will make it if 
                    you help!</p> <p>If you have an idea or a prototype for a drum machine that can live on the web, 
                    <a href="https:/www.maxy.world/" target="_blank">please reach out</a>&nbsp;<3</p>
